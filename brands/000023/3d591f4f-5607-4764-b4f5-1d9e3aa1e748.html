    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Our Sustainable Home Loan provides a great incentive to members for investing in environmentally friendly and sustainable features for their new home, or for adding them to their existing home. There are also all the features you'd expect, like up to 8 100% offset accounts, along with unlimited advance payments and redraws. But the real incentive is a considerable discount off our standard variable interest rate!&quot;,
