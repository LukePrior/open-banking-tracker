    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;If you don\u2019t want to secure your loan against an asset, but you have something you need to fund (like a holiday or a house renovation) this may be the loan for you. It\u2019s also great for consolidating credit card debt. Loan amounts can be between $5,000 up to $20,000.&quot;,
