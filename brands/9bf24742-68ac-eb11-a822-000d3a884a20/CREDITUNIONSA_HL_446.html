    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bridging Home Loan&quot;,
    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Our Bridging Home Loan allows you to purchase a new Owner Occupied property before selling your current home - taking a lot of the stress out of the process. You can choose to make monthly interest only repayments or you can have the interest added  (capitalised) to your loan during the bridging period.  Nil-end debt loans are not available for non-members (members for less than 12 months) where the end debt is less thant $300,000.&quot;,
