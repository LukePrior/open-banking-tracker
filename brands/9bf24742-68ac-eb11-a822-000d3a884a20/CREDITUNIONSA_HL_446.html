    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Our Bridging Home Loan lets you purchase the new property before selling your current home. You can choose to make monthly interest payments or have the interest capitalised to your loan during the bridging period, keeping your costs at a minimum while you sell your existing home.  Nil-end debt is not available for non-members (members for less than 12 months). Non-members are eligible for an end debt of $300k+.&quot;,
