                    &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;Your monthly balances for calculating your free transactions allowance are the total closing balances on the last day of the previous month of all your deposit, loan, overdraft and credit card accounts. Unused limits on overdrafts and credit cards are not considered. Negative balances of deposit accounts are deducted from the total. Balances in joint accounts are considered towards the allowance for the primary account holder only. Any unused transaction allowance cannot be carried forward to offset fees in future months. The maximum rebate paid in any given month will not exceed the amount incurred in eligible fees.&quot;,
