            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;Interest is charged daily and is charged on the balance owing on your account for the end of that day if it is a debit balance. If the balance owing on your account exceeds the overdraft limit (or if a transaction would cause this to happen) we may, without notice, decline, stop or reverse the transaction or we may choose to honour the transaction. You will be charged a fee when we exercise our discretion to honour the transaction. If the overdraft limit is exceeded, you must immediately repay the excess. Higher interest charges may apply until you do so.&quot;
