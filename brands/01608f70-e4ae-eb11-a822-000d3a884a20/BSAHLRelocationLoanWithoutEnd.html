Lenders Mortgage Insurance insures bank for any shortfall in the event that you default on your loan and if the proceeds from the property sale are not enough to pay off the loan in full. The cost of Lenders Mortgage Insurance is calculated as a percentage of the loan amount. The percentage applied will vary depending on a number of factors. Please speak to your lender if you would like to understand this process in more detail. The cost of Lenders Mortgage Insurance premium is passed on to you. We do not receive a commission on Lenders Mortgage Insurance.&quot;
