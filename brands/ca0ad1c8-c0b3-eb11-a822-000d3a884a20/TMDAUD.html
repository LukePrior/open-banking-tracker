            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;If you wish to withdraw the funds from the Term Deposit account prior to maturity, you will need to provide 31 days' notice (except in certain cases of hardship). An early withdrawal administration fee and interest reduction will apply. Interest rate reduction on early withdrawal: If you take any money out of your Term Deposit Account before the end of the term, the interest rate you receive will only be half of the interest rate that is set out in your Term Deposit Details and a $30 administration fee will apply. The reduced interest rate will only apply for the whole period from the day your account is opened to the day you take out your account. If you have already been paid interest at the full rate the principal amount payable to you when we close the account will be reduced to put you in the same position as if interest on the amount deposited had been reduced by 50% for the whole time the account was open. Note: The above reduction in interest rate and the $30 administration fee applies to Term Deposit Accounts in Australia and foreign currencies and are the AUD equivalent in the currency of the account when converted.&quot;,
