            &quot;additionalValue&quot;: &quot;The Unarranged Lending Rate (ULR) is a debit interest rate charged to a transaction account if it becomes overdrawn without arrangement. It will be calculated daily on the debit balance (and deducted on the last business day of each month) using the then current ULR until the account balance is positive again.&quot;
