            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;If your deposit is less than 20% then Lenders Mortgage Insurance is usually required. There may be other circumstances where Lenders Mortgage Insurance is also required. As Lenders Mortgage Insurance reduces bank's risk as a lender when providing a home loan, you may be able to apply for a home loan and get into your home sooner, with a lower deposit. Lenders Mortgage Insurance insures bank for any shortfall in the event that you default on your loan and if the proceeds from the property sale are not enough to pay off the loan in full. The cost of Lenders Mortgage Insurance is calculated as a percentage of the loan amount. The percentage applied will vary depending on a number of factors. Please speak to your lender if you would like to understand this process in more detail. The cost of Lenders Mortgage Insurance premium is passed on to you. We do not receive a commission on Lenders Mortgage Insurance.&quot;
