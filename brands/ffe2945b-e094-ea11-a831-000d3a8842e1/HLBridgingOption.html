The size of the bridging loan is calculated on the available equity in your current home.There are two types of bridging loans - Closed bridging loans which is used if you already have a Contract of Sale on your current property and know the date when your home will be sold and the funds received. You'll pay down the loan plus any accrued interest and fees on this date. The other type of bridging loan is Open bridging loans which is used if your current home hasn't been sold yet. An open bridging loan can be arranged for up to 12 months.&quot;
