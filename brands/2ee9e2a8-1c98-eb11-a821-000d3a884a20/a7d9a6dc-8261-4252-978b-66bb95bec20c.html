This is known as \u2018Preservation rules\u2019. As super enjoys tax advantages, the law restricts when you are able to access this money. These restrictions are known as \u2018Preservation rules\u2019. The objectives of these rules are to ensure that your funds are used for their intended purpose which is to provide financial security in retirement. Until such time that a condition of release is met, your preserved and restricted non-preserved benefit must remain within the superannuation system. In summary, your Capital Guaranteed Super account is subject to preservation rules and are only payable in certain situations.
