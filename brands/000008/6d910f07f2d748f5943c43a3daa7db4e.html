            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;If the fixed interest rate changes between the disclosure date on your loan contract and the loan funding date, the applicable fixed interest rate on your loan will be the rate at the date of your loan funding - which could be a higher (or lower) rate. If you request we can rate lock your fixed interest rates prior to the loan being funded, for a non-refundable $750 fee. If we agree, we'll lock your fixed interest rates from when we receive your completed rate lock form and will end 90 days after we process your rate lock request. The interest rates on your loan won't change for your elected fixed rate period. You can ask us to break the rate lock (for example, if rates go down) and revert to the rates available on the funding date.&quot;,
