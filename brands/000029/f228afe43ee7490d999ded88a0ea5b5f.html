A paper transaction is any customer or third party initiated transaction in the form of a deposit or withdrawal including cheque deposit or withdrawal made at a Bankwest-branded Branch or Bank@Post or any deposit, cheque withdrawal and each cheque deposited. For example - A deposit to an account with two cheques will count as three transactions, one for the deposit (which is charged as a branch transaction) and one for each cheque lodged because each item requires individual processing. Additionally, one or more of the paper based service fees described in our Bankwest Your Guide to Banking Fees brochure will also apply each time a paper based service described in that brochure is provided. Each such service fee will apply regardless of whether a paper transaction fee described above is payable.&quot;
