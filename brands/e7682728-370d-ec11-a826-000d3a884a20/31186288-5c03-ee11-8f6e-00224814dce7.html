    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The overdraft facility is an optional feature of the BOQ Specialist One account. The facility can help you to manage your cash flow, particularly when paying for practice expenses. It can give you an unsecured line of credit and you don't have to use your personal property as security. You only pay interest on what you use, not on the entire credit limit.&quot;,
