    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;You've rented or purchased premises for your practice and now you need to fit it out with fixtures and fittings to make it look professional. We know it's a complex task, with all sorts of hidden pitfalls and unforeseen costs that can be exacerbated by restrictions of the finance you've arranged. We make it easy with a flexible escrow facility which covers everything - and we mean everything, from dry walling right down to carpets, windows, paint and plumbing. We manage the payments to suppliers under your instruction and you pay the total amount back in one simple repayment structure. Fit-outs are a large investment in your practice and while it's important that you choose the right assets and equipment, it's equally important that you choose the right kind of financing.&quot;,
