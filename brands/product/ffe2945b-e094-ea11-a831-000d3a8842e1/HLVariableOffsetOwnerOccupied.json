The cost of Lenders Mortgage Insurance is calculated as a percentage of the loan amount. The percentage applied will vary depending on a number of factors. Please speak to your lender if you would like to understand this process in more detail. The cost of Lenders Mortgage Insurance premium is passed on to you.
