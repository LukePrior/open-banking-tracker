In a volatile market, the value of your investment loan portfolio may fall to a level where it no longer provides adequate security for your investment loan and can trigger a margin call. If this happens you will be required to bring your loan balance back under your borrowing limit.The margin loan is a full recourse loan - even if the value of your security portfolio falls to zero, you are still liable to repay the total loan balance outstanding. We recommend you seek independent financial and taxation advice before acting on this information. Please refer to the Westpac Online Investment Product Disclosure Statement for more information."
