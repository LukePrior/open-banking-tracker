Our extensive experience in lending to doctors, dentists and vets means that we understand the value of your profession and are able to lend against the practice\u2019s goodwill and equipment, rather than your home.\n\nWe can lend up to 100% of the amount you need to buy an existing practice without requiring you to use your home or other property as security. We can also lend up to 100% of the amount you need to buy into an existing partnership or increase your share in a practice. Existing partners can remain unaffected as we only take security interest over your share of the partnership.",
