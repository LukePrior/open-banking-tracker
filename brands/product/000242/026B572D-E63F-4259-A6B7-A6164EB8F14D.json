        "description": "You\u2019ve rented or purchased premises for your practice and now you need to fit it out with fixtures and fittings to make it look professional. We know it\u2019s a complex task, with all sorts of hidden pitfalls and unforeseen costs that can be exacerbated by restrictions of the finance you\u2019ve arranged.\nWe make it easy with a flexible escrow facility which covers everything \u2013 and we mean everything, from dry walling right down to carpets, windows, paint and plumbing. We manage the payments to suppliers under your instruction and you pay the total amount back in one simple repayment structure. Fit-outs are a large investment in your practice and while it\u2019s important that you choose the right assets and equipment, it\u2019s equally important that you choose the right kind of financing.",
