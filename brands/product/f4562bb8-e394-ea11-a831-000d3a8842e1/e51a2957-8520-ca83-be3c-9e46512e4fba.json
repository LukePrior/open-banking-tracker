An ATM operator fee may also apply. If the account is in credit balance at the time we process the cash advance, the credit amount will offset the amount of the cash advance in the calculation of the 3% fee. Please note that the credit balance at the time depends on when credits and debits are processed or posted to your account by ANZ, and the order they are processed in, in accordance with your account terms and conditions. Amounts and transactions displayed to you, including via ANZ mobile banking, internet banking, ATMs (including non-ANZ ATMs) and receipts (including ATM and teller receipts) may reflect both completed and pending credit or debit transactions. The credit balance may be affected by the completion, rejection or reversal of those transactions or other subsequent transactions. This means, for example, if you perform a credit transaction on your account after the close of business on the business day prior to performing a cash advance, or on the same day as performing a cash advance, the amount of that credit transaction may not form part of the credit balance which is offset against the amount of the cash advance in the calculation of the 3% fee even though the credit transaction may appear to be available. The 3% fee will be calculated with reference to the cash advance amount in Australian dollars (including any related charge such as any ATM operator fee) plus any Overseas Transaction Fee charged on the transaction. A minimum fee of $4.00 will apply for cash advances made outside Australia at an ATM, bank or other financial institution or ANZ office."
