    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;With a fixed interest home loan rate your repayments remain the same for the selected term.\rWith a guaranteed interest rate you know exactly how much you're going to pay every time. At the end of the selected term, the home loan interest rate converts to our Standard Variable Home Loan rate current at that time.\r\rA fixed home loan rate is great if you're buying an owner-occupied home, investment property, vacant land or refinancing home loans from another lender, and if you want protection from interest rate increases and certainty of repayments.&quot;,
