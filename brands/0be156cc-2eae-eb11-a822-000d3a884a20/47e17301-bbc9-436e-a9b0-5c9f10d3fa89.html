    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Our Offset Account is an everyday access account attached to your home loan. Your account balance is 100% offset against your linked Home Loan before the interest is calculated. So you pay less. The interest you save with an Offset Account can be huge over the life of the loan, and you can help shorten your loan term by years. &quot;,
