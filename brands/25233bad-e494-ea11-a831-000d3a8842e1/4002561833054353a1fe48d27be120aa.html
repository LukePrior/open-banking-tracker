            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;A balance transfer is when you request an amount owing on a personal Australian-bank issued credit card or store card to be transferred to your Commonwealth Bank credit card. This can help you save on interest charges and enables you to manage your finances in one spot. There is no fee charged to transfer the balance, however, interest will apply from the date of the transfer. From 1 December 2023, we will no longer accept new balance transfer requests on our credit cards.&quot;
