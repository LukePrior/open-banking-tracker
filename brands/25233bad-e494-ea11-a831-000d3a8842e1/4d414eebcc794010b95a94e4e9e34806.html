            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;Fixed Rates are subject to change up until funding. 'Rate Lock' is an optional feature that allows you to lock in your reference interest rates on new Fixed Rate Home Loan and Fixed Rate Investment Home Loan applications for 90 days for a non-refundable fee, charged per fixed rate loan account. This excludes Home Seeker applications, CommBank Green Loan applications, switching, splitting, top-ups, loan purpose transfers or repayment changes. Rate Lock can be requested any time before loan documents are issued and the reference interest rates applicable to your Rate Lock will be on the date we receive the completed Rate Lock consent from all applicants. The Rate Lock fee will be debited from your Related Account when the Rate Lock request is processed. If there are insufficient funds in that account, or the account is no longer open, then the Rate Lock fee will be charged to your home loan and your home loan will go into arrears (and fees may be charged). The 90 days commences when the Rate Lock request is processed. You can ask us to break the Rate Lock before funding (for example, if rates go down) and revert to the reference interest rates available on the funding date.&quot;,
