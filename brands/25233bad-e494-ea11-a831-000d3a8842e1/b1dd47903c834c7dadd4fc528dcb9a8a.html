Approvals are conditional and subject to the replacement asset being suitable to the Bank. Acceptable evidence of good payment history is required. The asset being purchased must not be older than the asset being replaced. The finance agreement on the asset being replaced must be repaid and the new repayment must not increase by more than 25 per cent. Additional information may be requested depending on your application details, the asset being financed and individual circumstances.&quot;,
