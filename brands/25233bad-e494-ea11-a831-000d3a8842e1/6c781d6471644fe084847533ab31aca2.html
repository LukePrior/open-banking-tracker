            &quot;additionalValue&quot;: &quot;Redraw&quot;,
            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;Your home loan comes with a fee-free redraw facility. You can make unlimited additional repayments at any time with no fees or penalties. You can access any additional money you pay, over and above your minimum required repayment.&quot;,

            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;An Everyday Offset account is a transaction account that's linked to your Standard Variable Rate home loan or Investment home loan. Any money you put into your Everyday Offset account (e.g. your salary and savings) - whether its $2 or $20,000 - reduces the balance on which we charge interest. This means you'll only be paying interest on the difference. You can have multiple Everyday Offset accounts linked to one home loan. Only available for individual borrowers, not companies or trusts.&quot;,
