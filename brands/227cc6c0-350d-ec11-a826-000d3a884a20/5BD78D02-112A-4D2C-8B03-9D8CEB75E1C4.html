The APR (Annual Percentage Rate) that applies to each balance type (e.g. a balance transfer) also applies to related fees and interest. The Retail APR applies to retail purchase balance.

The daily percentage rate is the applicable APR divided by 365. Information on any APR is available on request.&quot;,
