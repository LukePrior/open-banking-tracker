The APR (Annual Percentage Rate) that applies to each balance type (e.g. a balance transfer) also applies to related fees and interest. The Retail APR applies to retail purchase balance. To calculate that interest, we multiply the applicable daily percentage rate by the daily unpaid balance of its balance type (including related fees and interest) for each day of that statement period, and then add those amounts together. The daily percentage rate is the applicable APR divided by 365. Information on any APR is available on request.&quot;,
