    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Whether due to extra repayments or a capital gain, chances are some equity may have built up in your home over time.   Accessing this equity, to have a transactional facility with a set credit limit, secured by a property, is what a line of credit home loan can offer, subject to being able to service the loan. With an approved limit in place, you can access those funds for any investment purposes.&quot;,
