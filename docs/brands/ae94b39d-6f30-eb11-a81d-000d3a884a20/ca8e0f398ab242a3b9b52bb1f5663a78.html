            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;We will send you a confirmation letter when you open and renew your term deposit. For term deposits with a term of six months or more, we will give you an account statement every six months. We will also send you a term deposit reinvestment notice before it matures, not only as a reminder but to also explain what you can do next.&quot;

            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;The deposit must not be used as security for any amount owed to us or any other person. Additionally, the deposit must not be used, as a mortgage offset account or otherwise, to reduce your liability to pay interest on other debts owed to us.&quot;

            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;Changes aimed at strengthening the banking system mean we need 31 days' notice if you want to withdraw your funds before the maturity date. You can still access your money at maturity and during the grace period. You may request the withdrawal of all or part of your funds prior to the maturity date provided that you give 31 days' notice. If your Term Deposit has less than 31 days to maturity, you will only be able to access funds on the maturity date. The notice period starts on the day you request withdrawal. If you are experiencing hardship and need your funds before maturity, please contact us. If you withdraw all or part of your funds prior to the maturity date, your entitlement to interest in respect of the deposit will be reduced, according to when an early repayment is made and your entitlement to tax benefits will be impacted. Please refer to the Term Deposits Terms &amp; Conditions for further details. However, 31 days notice is not required to transfer funds to a different farm management deposit account. You will be required to provide written request and cover the cost to transfer the total or part of the credit balance to the other financial institution.&quot;

            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;At the end of your term, unless we notify you that we will not be renewing your deposit, you have seven calendar days (known as your 'grace period') to let us know you want to withdraw your funds or reinvest them. If you don't let us know, your funds will be automatically reinvested for the same term at the applicable rate.&quot;

            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;The Commonwealth's Farm Management Deposit Scheme allows primary producers, under the Pay As You Go system, to reduce their instalment income for an instalment period by the amount of the Farm Management Term Deposit (FMTD) made during that period. The scheme provides tax benefits if deposits in the FMTD are kept for a minimum of 12 months. The reduction is limited to the amount that you can reasonably expect to deduct for the deposit for the income year in which the deposit is made. However, the instalment income for the period cannot be reduced below nil.&quot;

            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;When you withdraw funds from the Farm Management Term Deposit within 12 months of the initial deposit, you may not qualify for the full tax benefits associated as the funds may cease to qualify as a farm management deposit. You may have to seek an amended tax assessment for the relevant period in which a deduction was claimed. If neither your tax file number, nor Australian Business Number, has been given to the Bank, the amount withdrawn will also be subject to withholding tax at a rate equal to the sum of the top marginal tax rate and the Medicare levy.&quot;

Specific requirements applying to this account are set out in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. A breach of the requirements may result in the deposit not being treated as a farm management deposit and the loss of tax benefits. Prior to making a deposit, we recommend you obtain advice from an independent tax adviser.&quot;
