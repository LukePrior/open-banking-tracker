            &quot;additionalInfo&quot;: &quot;This offer is available for approved applicants when they apply for a new Credit Card from 6 May 2021. This is a limited time only offer which may be withdrawn or changed at any time without notice. Offer not available to transfers from credit cards that you already have with us. Only one application per account accepted (consolidate up to  3 credit cards per application). The balance transfer application must be applied for within three months of the Disclosure Date in your Offer and Card Contract. Your total balance transfer may not exceed 80% of your credit limit. We may allow this to be exceeded at our discretion. The Promotional Interest Rate Period of 0% p.a. will apply for 25 months from the date the balance transfer application is processed. At the end of the Promotional Interest Rate Period, the Cash Advance rate (currently 21.74%p.a. as at 1 June 2021, subject to change) will apply to any part of the balance transfer which remains unpaid. The 55 days interest free period on purchases will not apply while any balance transfer amount remains outstanding. This means that all purchases will be charged interest at the applicable annual percentage rate.&quot;
